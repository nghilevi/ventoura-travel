						    <strong>Privacy Policy and File description of the Ventoura Application user register</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						    Last Updated: [14/07/2014]
						</p>
						<p>
						    Ventoura, Inc. ("Ventoura", "we" or "us") provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and
						    disclosure of personal information we receive from users of our application for mobile devices (the "Application"). This Privacy Policy applies only to
						    information that you provide to us through the Application. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the
						    same meanings as in our Terms of Service [live link to be inserted].
						</p>
						<p>
						    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any
						    material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your Ventoura Account) or by means of a notice on the Application
						    prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. By
						    continuous use of the Application, you accept these changes to the Privacy Policy.
						</p>
						<p>
						    <strong>What Personal Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use It</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						    Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, Application, services, features and content, to administer your use of the
						    Application and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Application. We use your Personal Information to provide the Service and administer your
						    inquiries as well as to complete your transactions.
						</p>
						<p>
						    Personal data which we collect about you is information including, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, email address, and home postal address,
						    but does not include your credit card number or billing information ("Identity Information"). In order to process some of your transactions through the
						    Application, we may also ask for your credit card number and other billing information ("Billing Information") (Identity Information and Billing
						    Information together, "Personal Information").
						</p>
						<p>
						    If you decide to register by logging into a third party social media service account via our Application, we will obtain the Personal Information you have
						    provided to the applicable third party social network service ("SNS") (such as your "real" name, email address, profile picture, names of SNS friends,
						    names of SNS groups to which you belong, other information you make publicly available via the applicable SNS and/or other information you authorize
						    Ventoura to access by authorizing the SNS to provide such information) from your Third Party Accounts and use that information to create your Ventoura
						    Account and Ventoura Account profile page and you will become a Member.
						</p>
						<p>
						    Depending on the SNS you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such SNS, you understand that by granting us access to your SNS
						    accounts, we will access, make available and store (if applicable and as permitted by the SNS and authorized by you) the information in your SNS accounts
						    so that it is available on and through your Ventoura Account on the Application. If there is information about your "friends" or people with whom you are
						    associated in your SNS account, the information we obtain about those "friends" or people with whom you are associated, may also depend on the privacy
						    settings such people have with the applicable SNS.
						</p>
						<p>
						    When you create a Ventoura Account, we will set up a Ventoura Account profile page for you. Your Ventoura Account profile page will include your first
						    name. You can select the other items of Personal Information that you wish to be included in your Ventoura Account profile page including, but not limited
						    to, a profile picture, a biography and links to your Listings, if applicable (together, your "Profile Information"). We will display your Profile
						    Information in your Ventoura Account profile page publicly via the Application, and, with your prior permission, on third party sites. Any information you
						    choose to provide as part of your Profile Information will be publicly visible to all Ventoura Users.
						</p>
						<p>
						    We may use information provided by you via, (i) a SNS, or (ii) directly through the Application, including, Age, Gender, SNS "Friends", SNS Images, SNS
						    email address, Itinerary, Tour history, Ratings, Matches, User type, Application usage history, Payment information and Conversation data. In addition,
						    when you provide a Service through the Application, we may publish that Service publicly via the Application and may enable third parties to publish your
						    Service on their websites through the use of an HTML "widget". You can review and revise your Profile Information at any time.
						</p>
						<p>
						    We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Ventoura newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of
						    interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions
						    provided in any of the communications or update your "Notifications" information. See "Changing or Deleting Information" below.
						</p>
						<p>
						    <strong>Log Data and Anonymised Data</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						    Our servers automatically record information that your device sends whenever you visit the Application ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information
						    such as your device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Application, pages of our
						    Application that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Application, access times and dates, and other statistics. We
						    use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Application and for the Application's technical administration, to increase our Application's
						    functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Application to our visitors' needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to
						    the Application meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other
						    Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated below regarding other Non-Identifying
						    Information.
						</p>
						<p>
						    We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your Ventoura Account profile
						    (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences or demographic information) ("Non-Identifying Information").We may combine your
						    Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Ventoura Users to attempt to provide you with
						    a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Application is used. We may also use the
						    combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to advertise or deliver a product or service to you according to your
						    preferences or restrictions.
						</p>
						<p>
						    We may share aggregated, anonymised information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and
						    Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not
						    contain your Personal Information.
						</p>
						<p>
						    Any data provided by you to Ventoura can be stored on any Ventoura server or on a third-party server located anywhere in the world.
						</p>
						<p>
						    <strong>Disclosure and Transfer of Personal Data</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						    Ventoura is not in the business of selling your Personal Information to third parties.
						</p>
						<p>
						    Personal Information may, however, occasionally be disclosed in accordance with applicable legislation and this Privacy Policy. Additionally, Ventoura may
						    disclose personal data to its parent companies and its subsidiaries in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In particular, Billing Information submitted
						    via the Application is processed by a third party provider in accordance with security protocols set out in the "Security" section of this Privacy Policy.
						</p>
						<p>
						    Ventoura may hire agents and contractors to collect and process personal data on Ventoura's behalf and in such cases such agents and contractors will be
						    instructed to comply with our Privacy Policy and to use personal data only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by Ventoura.
						    Ventoura may use third party service providers such as credit card processors, e-mail service providers, shipping agents, data analyzers and business
						    intelligence providers. Ventoura has the right to share your personal data as necessary for the aforementioned third parties to provide their services for
						    Ventoura. Ventoura is not liable for the acts and omissions of these third parties, except as provided by mandatory law.
						</p>
						<p>
						    We may also provide Personal Information to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing you with information on goods or
						    services we believe will be of interest to you. You can, at any time, opt out of receiving such communications.
						</p>
						<p>
						    Ventoura may disclose your personal data to third parties as required by law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation
						    of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or Ventoura to legal liability.
						</p>
						<p>
						    Ventoura may also disclose your personal data to third parties when Ventoura has a reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or
						    actual injury or interference with Ventoura's rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or Ventoura
						    believes that such disclosure is necessary to protect Ventoura's rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal
						    process served on Ventoura. If you request to make a booking via the Application, Ventoura will share the following information about you with the
						    applicable Member: (i) your first name, and (ii) a link to your Ventoura Account profile page. In addition, subject to your authorization, Ventoura may
						    share (iii) the names of any members of an SNS with whom you are "friends" or associated on the SNS if such individuals are also "friends" or associated
						    with the Host on such SNS, and (iv) an indication that the name that you provided to Ventoura when you became a Member matches the name that you provided
						    to the SNSs to which you have linked your Ventoura Account. All of this information will enable the Local to decide whether to confirm or reject your
						    booking.
						</p>
						<p>
						    <strong>Sessions &amp; Cookies</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						    Like many mobile applications, we use "Sessions" to collect information. We use sessions for two purposes. First, we utilize sessions to save your login
						    information for future logins to the Application. Second, we utilize sessions to enable certain features of the Application, to better understand how you
						    interact with the Application and to monitor aggregate usage by Ventoura Users and web traffic routing on the Application.
						</p>
						<p>
						    Third party advertisers on the Application may place or read cookies on your device. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your device for
						    record-keeping purposes. You can instruct your device, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from
						    the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Application or all functionality of the
						    Application.
						</p>
						<p>
						    Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a Ventoura User's prior visits to Ventoura. You can disable these specific cookies
						    that track prior visits for the sake of follow-up advertising by opting out at http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html
						</p>
						<p>
						    <strong>Web Beacons</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						    Our Application may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile
						    aggregated statistics to analyze how our Application is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened
						    by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.
						</p>
						<p>
						    <strong>Changing or Deleting Your Information</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						    All Members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by contacting us at terms@ventoura.com [final
						    address to be inserted] or editing the relevant part of their profile. If you would like us to cancel your Ventoura Account, please contact us or select
						    the "Cancel Account" feature of the Service and we will attempt to accommodate your request if we do not have any legal obligation or a legitimate business
						    reason to retain the information contained in your Ventoura Account. Please note that, if you cancel your Ventoura Account, any reviews you have posted via
						    the Application will remain publicly viewable via the Application. Please see below for privacy contact information.
						</p>
						<p>
						    <strong>Security and Phishing</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						    Ventoura is very concerned with safeguarding your information. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or
						    order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card
						    information, your Ventoura Account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.
						    We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No
						    method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
						    By using the Application, you assume this risk. If you have any questions about security on our Application, you can contact us.
						</p>
						<p>
						    We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored
						    "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Application in the
						    most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures
						    necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
						</p>
						<p>
						    <strong>Our Policy Toward Children</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						    The Site and Application are not directed to individuals under 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 18.
						    If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us.
						    If we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.

						    <strong>Bookings and Financial Terms</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						    <u>Bookings and Financial Terms for Locals</u>
						    
						</p>
						<p>
						    If you are a Local and a booking is requested for your Service via the Application by a Traveller (<strong>Booking</strong>), you will be required to
						    either confirm or reject the Booking (<strong>Confirmation</strong>) within a period of time, as determined by Ventoura, after the Booking is requested in
						    the Application or the Booking will be automatically cancelled. When a Booking is made via the Application, we will share with you the first name of the
						    Traveller who has requested the booking, and a link to the Traveller's Ventoura Account profile page.
						</p>
						<p>
						    If you do not make Confirmation as indicated above, no Service Fee will be collected from a Traveller. When you confirm a Booking, Ventoura will send you
						    either an email, text message or message via the Application as selected by you confirming such Booking.
						</p>
						<p>
						    The fees displayed in each Service are the "<strong>Service Fees</strong>". The Service Fee comprises of a "<strong>Ventoura Fee</strong>" payable to, and
						    determined by, Ventoura, and a "<strong>Local Fee"</strong>. The Service Fee is determined by a Local for each Service. Please note that even though a
						    Local determines the Service Fee, Ventoura is entitled to determine a permitted monetary range which a Service Fee must fall within.
						</p>
						<p>
						    You, as a Local, further acknowledge, that, when providing Services as a Local, and where you have elected Service payment to be via the Application,
						    Ventoura will collect the Local Fee as a part of the Service Fee determined by you, and Ventoura will pay the Local Fee to you, as a Local, within 7 days
						    after a respective Service has taken place. Local Fee for a Service will be paid by Ventoura to you, as a Local, via check, PayPal, direct deposit or other
						    payment methods described on the Application, in euro currency. If you have elected in your Service listing for payment to be made in cash at the time of
						    the agreed Service taking place, you acknowledge that Ventoura has no role in the transaction or transfer of funds.
						</p>
						<p>
						    You, as a Local, agree that Ventoura may, from time to time, ask for evidence that a Service has been provided to a Traveller as agreed. This information
						    may be used in order to resolve cancellation and refund disputes, as set out in the "Cancellations and Refunds" section of this Terms of Service.
						</p>
						<p>
						    You acknowledge that you shall be solely liable for payment of any applicable taxes which may become payable from Local Fees.
						</p>
						<p>
						    <u>Bookings and Financial Terms for Travellers</u>
						</p>
						<p>
						    If you, as a Traveller, choose to make a Booking regarding a Service provided by a Local, you agree and understand that you will be required to agree to
						    accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Service imposed by the Local, if any. Further, in order to hold a Confirmed
						    Booking, you must submit to Ventoura your true and accurate credit card information, if requested by Ventoura in the Application. Failure to provide true
						    and accurate credit card information within 24 hours of Confirmation will result in cancellation of the Booking.
						</p>
						<p>
						    Each Service will specify the applicable Service Fee. If a Confirmed Booking is cancelled by the applicable Local, any amounts charged by Ventoura will be
						    refunded to Traveller, depending on the selections the Traveller makes via the Application, and any pre-authorization of such Traveller's credit card will
						    be released, if applicable. Upon your payment of Service Fee to Ventoura regarding a Service, your payment obligation to the Local for such amounts is
						    extinguished, and Ventoura is responsible for payment of Local Fee to such Local.
						</p>
						<p>
						    You agree to pay Ventoura for the Service Fees for any Booking requested in connection with your Ventoura Account if such requested Bookings are confirmed
						    by the applicable Local and where that Service is stated to be paid through the Application. Once a booking has been confirmed by the Local and you have
						    provided credit card information, you understand and agree that Ventoura reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via
						    your credit card for the Service Fee or (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one euro(1&#8364;) to verify your credit card. Once Ventoura
						    receives Confirmation of your Booking from the Local, Ventoura will charge the Service Fee from your true and accurately provided credit card information.
						    Some Locals may request Service Fees to be paid in cash, as described in the Service listing, at the time of the agreed Service taking place. It is your
						    responsibility to settle amounts owing in this matter; Ventoura is not involved in such transactions.
						</p>
						<p>
						    You agree that if Your Booking was made more than seven (7) days prior to the date of the Service, payment can be made at any time after Confirmation, as
						    requested by Ventoura. Payment must be made at least 7 days before the agreed Tour date or the booking will be automatically cancelled. You agree that if
						    Your booking was made 7 days or less before the agreed Tour date, payment will be requested immediately after confirmation by the Local. If payment is not
						    made immediately, the booking will be automatically cancelled. These time periods do not apply if cash payment was requested in the Service listing, when
						    the agreed Service takes place.
						</p>
						<p>
						    If you are directed to Ventoura's third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party's service and
						    that third party's privacy policy. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your confirmed Booking is
						    complete, you will receive a confirmation email from Ventoura, summarizing your confirmed Booking.
						</p>
						<p>
						    <strong>12. </strong>
						    <strong>Cancellations and Refunds</strong>
						    <strong></strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						    If you, as a Traveller, cancel your Booking before a Confirmation has been submitted by a Local, in accordance with our payment structure, you will not
						    have made any payment and so will not be financially impacted. If, as a Traveller, you wish to cancel a confirmed Booking made via the Application, and,
						</p>
						<p>
						    i) Your Booking was initially made more than seven (7) days in advance of the agreed Service and your cancellation was more than 7 days in advance of the
						    agreed Service, then Ventoura will return the Service Fee paid, if any.
						</p>
						<p>
						    ii) Your Booking was initially made less than seven (7) days in advance of the agreed Service then Ventoura will not compensate you for any part of a paid
						    Service Fee.
						</p>
						<p>
						    If Ventoura is notified by the applicable Local that they are unable to complete the agreed confirmed Service, we will notify you at our earliest
						    convenience and return any Service Fee paid to the Traveller within a commercially reasonable time of such cancellation.
						</p>
						<p>
						    If, as a Local, you cancel a confirmed Booking, Ventoura may apply penalties or consequences to you or your Services, including (i) publishing an automated
						    review on your Services indicating that a confirmed Booking was cancelled, (ii) keeping the calendar for your Services unavailable or blocked for the dates
						    of the cancelled confirmed Booking, or (iii) imposing a cancellation fee (to be withheld from your future Local Fees). You will be notified of the
						    situations in which a cancellation fee applies as available from time to time before you decide to cancel.
						</p>
						<p>
						    In certain circumstance, Ventoura may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary or desirable to cancel a confirmed Booking. Ventoura may also
						    determine, in its sole discretion, to refund to the Traveller part or all of the amounts charged to the Traveller in accordance with the Refund Policy. You
						    agree that Ventoura and the relevant Traveller or Local will not have any liability for such cancellations or refunds.
						</p>
						<p>
						    <u>Disputes</u>
						</p>
						<p>
						If a Local does not turn up to provide a Confirmed Service, then a Traveller, has a period of 48 hours to lodge a dispute at    <a href="mailto:info@ventoura.net">info@ventoura.net</a>. Ventoura will automatically hold the Service Fees paid in escrow until either the dispute has
						    been resolved, or a period of 7 days has elapsed since the agreed date of the Services, whichever occurs first. If the Local does not adequately respond to
						    the dispute as determined by Ventoura, a Traveller will be refunded the Service Fees.
						</p>
						<p>
						    If you, as a Local, become involved in a dispute, you will be contacted by Ventoura to respond to a claim. We may request evidence from you that the
						    Service was provided as agreed. If you as a Local, or a Traveller, become involved in a dispute, you agree not to contact the applicable Local or Traveller
						    directly regarding the dispute.
						</p>
						<p>
						    You understand that if the dispute has not been resolved within 7 days of notification to Ventoura, Ventoura will arbitrate the outcome.
						</p>
						<p>
						    Please note that this dispute resolution process does not limit any rights and remedies which you may have under the applicable law.
						</p>
						<p>
						    <u>Locals</u>

						    If a Local cancelled a confirmed booking and you, as a Traveller, have not received an email or other communication from Ventoura, please contact Ventoura
